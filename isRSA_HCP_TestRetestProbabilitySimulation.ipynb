    "Because the primary goal of the empirical analyses in this paper was to perform model comparison -- i.e., to see which distance model (AnnaK versus NN) leads to higher detection power in an is-RSA analysis -- and not necessarily to interpret individual nodes as definitely (or definitely not) related to behavior, in addition to the Bonferroni-style correction method also shown in the paper, we can take a familywise approach to multiple comparisons and frame the problem as: how likely are we to see X nodes across the whole brain survive a given p threshold in both cohorts? This notebook runs simulations to test that.\n",

    "Again, note that unlike the Bonferroni-style method, this approach is not designed to test whether any particular node is definitely significant or not significant, but rather to broadly compare model detection power at the whole-brain level."
